            <b class="name"><i>Homer Jay Simpson</i></b> (born May 12, 1956) is
            the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
            spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.
            Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often
            ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he
            has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
            cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves
            as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts,
            drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the
            piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart
            Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".
          </p>
          <p>
            Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield
            Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent
            and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time
            at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny
            Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on
            the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking
            Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona
            Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him.
            Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma
            Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed
            to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a
            result of this, Homer is his legal adoptive father.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great
            achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an
            Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield
            many times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In
            a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated that he
            named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the
            Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson,
            but neither explanation is considered definitive.

            <b class="name"><i>Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson</i></b> (born
            April 1 or February 23) is the mischievous, rebellious,
            misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child
            of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer
            and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also
            has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's
            Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as
            "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter
            Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the
            Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
            Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

            Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an
            award for his Angry Dad web series, he has discovered a new comet
            which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful
            band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.

            <b class="name"><i>Lisa Marie Simpson</i></b> (born May 9) is the
            elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
            two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

            In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa
            Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her
            parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who
            exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of
            children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
            center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental
            involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as
            playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and
            interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is
            affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves
            her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to
            reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a
            member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement
            also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her
            or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and
            will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but
            only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one
            who usually thinks things through.
